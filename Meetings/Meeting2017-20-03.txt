Meeting Agenda
Date: 2017-03-20
Chair: Jonatan Källman 
Participants: Jonatan Källman, Filip Labe, Erik Sjöström, Sarosh Nasir
1. Objectives (5 min). Resolve any issues preventing the team to
continue.

Decide on what project.
When decided - How do we start? 
What are the primary functions/ use cases of our app?

2. Reports (15 min) from previous meeting

This is the first meeting, there's no previous meeting to discuss. 

3. Discussion items (35 min)
- Discuss issues from 1 and 2, possibly new or more general issues (very short notes and/or
keywords)

We threw ideas around making a "clicker" game for Android, which gives the player points for clicking and defeating enemies. 
We started to sketch some thoughts about the GUI and the app's function.

4. Outcomes and assignments (5 min)
- Outcomes from 3). I.e. write down what's decided and why it was decided? Sync with other
documentation (add terms to wordbook)
- From outcomes, 1), 2) and 3) (re)assign each group member issues to solve.

We decided, after some brainstorming, to make a game for Android with some sort of a "clicker" 
as well as an offline farm system. As we have not developed actual Android apps before, we 
decided on doing so to give us a challenge. 
We are still in the planning phase, so we have not split up any "issues to solve" within the group yet.

5. Wrap up
- Write down unresolved issues for next meeting.
- Time and location for next meeting

The structure and the design still needs a lot of work.
We still have not started making a domain model and/ or discussed any use cases, 
which is prioritized for the coming week.
Our next meeting takes place on Thursday, 2017-03-23.
