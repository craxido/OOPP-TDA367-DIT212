Meeting Agenda
Date: 2017-03-20
Chair: Jonatan Källman 
Participants: Jonatan Källman, Filip Labe, Erik Sjöström, Sarosh Nasir
1. Objectives (5 min). Resolve any issues preventing the team to
continue.

We need to do the following:
Simple GUI preview
Implement Use cases 
Construct a domain model

2. Reports (15 min) from previous meeting

We decided on what to do for the project, discussed simple GUI and use cases together. 
Most of the time went into discussing the project.

3. Discussion items (35 min)
- Discuss issues from 1 and 2, possibly new or more general issues (very short notes and/or
keywords)

We decided on making a simple GUI preview, using Adobe Fireworks to make it a bit interactive, 
as sketching on paper does not really give the same perspective.
We had issues with the constuction of the domain model as we did not fully understand what we were supposed to do.
 

4. Outcomes and assignments (5 min)
- Outcomes from 3). I.e. write down what's decided and why it was decided? Sync with other
documentation (add terms to wordbook)
- From outcomes, 1), 2) and 3) (re)assign each group member issues to solve.

As mentioned, Fireworks was used to structure the GUI preview in a better way.
Jonatan and Filip did most of the GUI preview as Erik and Sarosh discussed and constructed use cases.
After the GUI preview was made and some use cases were constructed, we worked all together on constructing a domain model.


5. Wrap up
- Write down unresolved issues for next meeting.
- Time and location for next meeting
 
For the next meeting, we should do some prototyping, finish the use cases 
and further develop the domain model.
Our next meeting takes place on Monday, 2017-03-27.
