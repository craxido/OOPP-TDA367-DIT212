\section{Introduction}
Our project is a game about defeating monsters. You do this by clicking \\
on the monsters with your finger. When defeated the monsters drop gold \\
which can be used to buy upgrades. There are three upgrades that can be \\
bought, upgrades to your damage, upgrades which provide damage every second \\
or upgrades which provide gold every second. When the player has defeated enough \\
monsters the player can progress to a new area and defeat monsters in a different \\
scenery.
