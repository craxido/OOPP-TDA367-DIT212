1. Objectives (5 min). Resolve any issues preventing the team to
continue.

We need to have a functioning GUI for thursday and have test cases written
in code.

2. Reports (15 min) from previous meeting

We have design model and we've decided that the game will be called
Gem Clicker.
Everyone has continued to look at android tutorials.

3. Discussion items (35 min)

As mentioned in the objectives, we need to have a functioning GUI to code our test cases
and have a functioning template for the game.
Use the information and skill gained from the tutorials to make a simple GUI to write test
cases in. 

4. Outcomes and assignments (5 min)

We've done some basic designing for the GUI but nothing in code. So what we're really lacking
at the moment is a GUI to work with. Thus our main objective and assignment right now is to get that
up and running. Once we have that we can start assigning tasks within the group.

5. Wrap up
- Write down unresolved issues for next meeting.
- Time and location for next meeting

We need to have a functioning GUI for thursday with implemented test cases.  

Our next meeting takes place on Thursday, 2017-04-06.
