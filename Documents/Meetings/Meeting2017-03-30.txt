Meeting Agenda
Date: 2017-03-30
Chair: Jonatan Källman 
Participants: Jonatan Källman, Filip Labe, Erik Sjöström, Sarosh Nasir
1. Objectives (5 min). Resolve any issues preventing the team to
continue.

We have to do some changes to the domain model after discussing it with our TA.
There's also a use case or two that needs to be corrected.
We need to come up with a name for the app.


2. Reports (15 min) from previous meeting

Everyone in the group has done a brief tutorial in Android Studio. 
We have not yet created a design model 
(this is for the next week but we thought we might start).

3. Discussion items (35 min)
- Discuss issues from 1 and 2, possibly new or more general issues (very short notes and/or
keywords)

Mainly, what needs to be addressed is correcting the domain model and the use cases.
These will be needed for the seminar and for the next weeks goals.
The design model must also be made or at least started on.

4. Outcomes and assignments (5 min)
- Outcomes from 3). I.e. write down what's decided and why it was decided? Sync with other
documentation (add terms to wordbook)
- From outcomes, 1), 2) and 3) (re)assign each group member issues to solve.

We decided to cut down a bit on the domain model to simplify it.
As Sarosh and Erik worked on correcting the domain model in Photoshop, 
Jonatan and Filip discussed the change in the use case(s) and edited some bits.
We also discussed the upcoming seminar.

5. Wrap up
- Write down unresolved issues for next meeting.
- Time and location for next meeting

We should check all the use cases so that they are correct.
The design model needs work. We will also have to start creating files and implementing tests 
for a runnable design model which is needed next week.
Before monday, our app name must be decided. 

Our next meeting takes place on Monday, 2017-04-03.
