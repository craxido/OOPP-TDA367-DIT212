\section{Introduction}
We have indentified a huge gap in the world of clicker games, namely 
Lord of the Rings based clicker games. Our project aims to fill that gap. \\
This game will simulate the adventure of Frodo and friends on their quest to
destroy the one ring, and will benifit anyone who likes both LOTR and clickers.\\
This game might be useful on the bus, to pass the time when moving between locataions, or when sitting on the toilet. 

\subsection{Definitions, acronyms, abbriviations}
